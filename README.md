# Europe-Sales-Project
I obtained the data from Kaggle, cleaned it using Excel corrected the format removed duplicates, and finally analysed it on MySQL.
SQL Project 

Analysing "Europe Sales Records"

My plan :
Become familiar with the dataset, clean it if needed sort the formatting, remove duplicates etc
import into MySQL and answer the following questions that interested me while familiarising myself with the data spreadsheet.

In SQL started by doing:

CREATE DATABASE SQL_Project;

USE SQL_Project;

SELECT * FROM sales;
